# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example)
##### (Keeping this for reference)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started an e-commerce app in react native to keep my app development skills sharp i guess. I spent a bunch of time trying to get expo router to work, it proved futile so i just stuck with react navigation. I managed to finish the first page(boarding screen) in the app

**Thoughts**: I've realised that i very much prefer mobile development to web development. Web development seems a lot more convoluted compared to mobile deelopment. I hope i can get a job with either tho, I really need to start doing well.

### Day 2: May 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I built out the sign in and sign up pages and switched stack navigators fromreact navigatoin native stack to react naviagtion stack because it has better typing. i also made a util function for error handling in forms and implemented error handling on both screens i did

**Thoughts**:I honestly have no idea why i've been coding for 6 hours, i'm updating this log by 9pm, I really want to get better at this. Tomorrow i plan to start the main home page and maybe the API backend for the app. I'm hoping for strength, i want to make a lot of progress. Bye now❤️

### Day 3: May 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: i practiced a little bit of node js and tested my hands at creating an api

**Thoughts**:i spent most of this day working on trakka and had very little time to work on node js, but i still got a little bit of work done

### Day 4: June 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created my first authentication rest api, spent a bunch of time coding it out and trying to understand how node works and what to and what not to do when setting up a project.


### Day 5:June 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I reworked the api i built on day 4 and made it work with cookies and sesstion tokens, i also played around with a bunch of cryptography, ways to secruely hash passwords ad store them and the lieks, it was a pretty fun day tbh.
