# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example)
##### (Keeping this for reference)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started an e-commerce app in react native to keep my app development skills sharp i guess. I spent a bunch of time trying to get expo router to work, it proved futile so i just stuck with react navigation. I managed to finish the first page(boarding screen) in the app

**Thoughts**: I've realised that i very much prefer mobile development to web development. Web development seems a lot more convoluted compared to mobile deelopment. I hope i can get a job with either tho, I really need to start doing well.
